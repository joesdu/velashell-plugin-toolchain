# VelaShell Plugin Development Guide (v1)

> Status: **Implemented and available with the repository**. This guide describes the currently implemented plugin system (dual host modes + full Avalonia UI); the long-term design blueprint for the complete plugin platform (permission system, plugin store, and more) lives in the **main repository** as documents 01–15 under
> [`docs-en/plugins/`](https://github.com/joesdu/VelaShell/tree/main/docs-en/plugins). Unimplemented parts follow the blueprint and will be delivered in phases as needed.

## 1. Architecture in One Minute

- **Dual host modes** (selected by manifest `hostMode`):
  - `inProcess` (default): the plugin runs in its own **collectible AssemblyLoadContext** inside the host process, with zero IPC overhead; panels can be docked into the main window's tab area;
  - `isolated`: the plugin runs in a separate VelaShell.PluginHost process (named-pipe RPC), so crashes and hangs do not affect the host; panels are separate card windows (use `inProcess` for true docked panels).
  The **plugin source code is identical** in both modes.
- **Dependency isolation**: the plugin resolves its bundled dependencies (any NuGet packages) from its plugin directory according to its `deps.json`, without interfering with the host; only two categories of assemblies are forcibly shared with the loader to guarantee type identity:
  `VelaShell.PluginSdk` and `Avalonia*` (therefore the Avalonia version must match the host, see §5.9).
- **Narrow waist contract**: plugins reference `VelaShell.PluginSdk` (BCL dependencies only); UI code uses full Avalonia directly (compile-only reference). **Never** copy the SDK or Avalonia assemblies into the plugin directory.
- **Fault isolation**: in-process mode uses full-path guards (a single plugin is marked Failed, but infinite loops and runaway memory cannot be prevented); isolated mode uses the process boundary (even a hard failure only loses that plugin).
- **Zero startup overhead**: discovery only reads `plugin.json` and does not touch assemblies, while discovery and activation run on a background thread after the main window is displayed; when there are no plugins, the startup path adds only two directory-existence checks.

The host-side implementation lives in the **main repository** [joesdu/VelaShell](https://github.com/joesdu/VelaShell):
`src/VelaShell.Infrastructure/Plugins/` (discovery/loading/activation/deactivation and capability bridging),
`src/VelaShell.Presentation/Plugins/` (bridge from command capabilities to the command registry), and
`src/VelaShell.PluginHost/` (isolated plugin host process: RPC proxy context, built-in Avalonia, dock embedding).

## 2. Quick Start

### 2.1 Where the First-Party Plugins Live

The officially maintained plugins (AI / Redis / S3 / Telnet, plus the HelloWorld example) live in
[joesdu/velashell-plugins](https://github.com/joesdu/velashell-plugins), not in this repository.

**They take exactly the same path your own plugin does** — they reference
`VelaShell.PluginSdk.Build` from nuget.org, with no in-repository privileges. So §2.2 below is the
whole story; follow it and you are done. For real-world examples (protocol capabilities, panels,
third-party dependencies shipped alongside the plugin), read any project under `plugins/` there.

That repository defines two extra things that only concern **shipping with the main application**.
You will not need them for a third-party plugin, but you will run into them when reading its csproj files:

- `<VelaPluginShip>` (default `true`): plugins set to `false` are excluded from
  `velashell-plugins-<version>.zip` and only laid out locally as examples (the HelloWorld example is `false`);
- after each build the output is mirrored to `artifacts/plugins/<directory name>/` and to the
  application directory named by `VELASHELL_DEV_APP_DIR` — effectively a built-in `vela-plugin dev init`.

> **Directory name = id with dots replaced by hyphens** (`velashell.ai` → `velashell-ai`). macOS `codesign`
> treats directories containing dots inside an `.app` as nested bundles. Using the id unchanged as the directory name causes signing to fail directly
> (`bundle format unrecognized, invalid, or unsuitable`). The directory name **does not participate in any logic**.
> The host enumerates subdirectories and reads the id from `plugin.json`, so this is only a packaging-side naming convention.
> Plugins the user installs from a `.vpx` into the data directory are still named by id (those live outside the `.app` and are not signed).

### 2.2 Plugins Outside the Repository (Third-Party): from `dotnet new` to installed in five minutes

The SDK ships as NuGet packages, and a plugin project needs **exactly one** of them.

```bash
# One-off: install the templates and the CLI
dotnet new install VelaShell.Plugin.Templates
dotnet tool install -g VelaShell.Plugin.Cli      # optional, see below

# Create the project (id = acme.snippets)
dotnet new velaplugin -n Snippets --publisher acme --authorName "Your Name"
#   velaplugin      basic: entry class + one command
#   velaplugin-ui   adds an Avalonia panel (AXAML)
#   --hostMode inProcess|isolated

cd Snippets
dotnet build -c Release -t:PackVpx               # → bin/vpx/acme.snippets-0.1.0.vpx
```

The generated `.csproj` has a single dependency:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="VelaShell.PluginSdk.Build" Version="1.5.0" />
```

That one package brings everything a plugin project needs: the `VelaShell.PluginSdk` contract assembly, **Avalonia pinned to exactly the host's version** (including its AXAML compiler), `EnableDynamicLoading`, `plugin.json` copied to the output, shared assemblies kept out of the plugin directory, build-time manifest validation, and the `PackVpx` target. Do **not** reference `VelaShell.PluginSdk` or `Avalonia` separately: a version mismatch fails the build with `VELA1001` instead of surfacing at runtime as a cross-load-context cast failure on the user's machine.

| Package | Referenced by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VelaShell.PluginSdk.Build` | **the plugin project** | All of the above. Reference this one alone |
| `VelaShell.PluginSdk` | (flows transitively) | Contract assembly, BCL-only |
| `VelaShell.PluginSdk.Testing` | the plugin's **test project** | `TestPluginContext` and in-memory capability doubles |
| `VelaShell.Plugin.Cli` (`vela-plugin`) | developer machine | dotnet tool: dev inner loop, doctor, validate, pack, sign |
| `VelaShell.Plugin.Templates` | developer machine | `dotnet new` templates |

> **The SDK is not a dotnet tool.** All three `VelaShell.PluginSdk*` packages are ordinary NuGet packages consumed via `PackageReference`; only `vela-plugin` (`VelaShell.Plugin.Cli`) is a dotnet tool. And **packing does not require installing it** — the packer ships inside `VelaShell.PluginSdk.Build`, so `dotnet build -t:PackVpx` works out of the box. Install the global tool to validate, sign, inspect packages, run `vela-plugin doctor`, or set up the development inner loop (`vela-plugin dev init`) outside a build.

**Method 1: from the plugin marketplace (least effort)**.

```bash
vela-plugin install velashell.redis      # since SDK 1.5.0
```

Fetches the package by id from the [marketplace](http://market.easilynet.top), checks its digests and signature, and extracts it into `~/.velashell/plugins/<id>/`; restart the host to load it. `search` / `list` / `update` / `uninstall` round it out — see the [CLI manual](cli.md#2-installing-from-the-marketplace).

**Method 2: `.vpx` package**. Sidebar plugin icon → Plugin Management page → select the file with "Install .vpx…" (validates the container and manifest, guards against zip slip and zip bombs, extracts into the user directory, replaces the old version for the same id, and activates according to the activation policy). The command-line equivalent is `vela-plugin install <package.vpx>`. Uninstallation is also a one-click operation on the management page (deletes the directory and clears database data).

> The management page and the CLI write to the **same directory**. The only difference is that the management page also records a protected installation receipt for post-install tamper detection; the CLI cannot produce that receipt, but it performs every pre-install check. The trade-off is spelled out in the CLI manual.

`.vpx` is VelaShell's **own container format**, not a renamed zip — see §12 for the layout and signing.

**Method 3: Place the directory directly**. Put the build output (entry DLL + deps.json + bundled dependencies + plugin.json) in:

```text
~/.velashell/plugins/<plugin id>/                    (Windows/Linux/macOS)
```

Restart VelaShell to load it. Again: do not put `VelaShell.PluginSdk.dll` or `Avalonia*.dll` there (the loader forcibly shares its own copies; adding them only increases the package size).

> Built-in application plugins (`<application directory>/plugins`) are read-only, so the management page does not offer uninstallation; user-installed plugins
> (`.vpx` files or directories placed in the user directory) can be uninstalled.

### 2.3 Inner Loop and Debugging

Third-party plugins do not need the "pack → install → look" cycle. Three steps:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g VelaShell.Plugin.Cli   # one-off
dotnet build
vela-plugin dev init                          # writes the IDE launch profile
```

Then press **F5** in your IDE (profile `VelaShell`). The full command surface is in the
[CLI manual](cli.md); this section explains what it does and why.

#### The host announces itself

`dev init` does not guess where VelaShell is installed — three platforms mean three sets of
install locations, plus portable copies and self-updates that moved the binary. Probing logic
is long and perpetually wrong. Instead, **the host writes itself into `~/.velashell/host.json`
on every launch**: executable path, version, apiLevel, bundled SDK version, Avalonia version,
data root, PluginHost path.

```bash
vela-plugin hosts     # list the installations registered on this machine
```

So there is exactly one prerequisite: **VelaShell must have been started at least once on this
machine**. If it has not, point the tool at the binary with `vela-plugin dev init --exe <path>`.
When several installations coexist (release plus preview), the most recently started one wins
by default and `--host 1.5` picks a specific one.

#### The generated launch profile

```jsonc
"VelaShell": {
  "commandName": "Executable",
  "executablePath": "…/VelaShell.exe",
  "commandLineArgs": "--dev-root …/Snippets/bin/Debug --wait-debugger acme.snippets --data-root …/.velashell-dev"
}
```

| Argument | The problem it solves |
| --- | --- |
| `--dev-root` | Mounts the project output into the host. It **travels with the project**, not with the machine — two plugin projects, or two branches, never contaminate each other |
| `--wait-debugger` | An isolated plugin's child process suspends **before loading the plugin assembly** and waits for you to attach |
| `--data-root` | The debug instance gets its own data root |

The third one is easy to underestimate: you almost certainly keep VelaShell open all day, and
**a second instance sharing the data root hits the single-instance guard** (SonnetDB holds an
exclusive lock on its WAL). It shows "already running" and exits cleanly — which looks exactly
like a broken launch profile. With a separate data root both instances coexist, and your
throw-away debug sessions never pollute your real configuration. To deliberately test inside
your everyday configuration, pass `--shared-data` (and quit the everyday instance first).

All three arguments have environment-variable equivalents (`VELA_PLUGIN_DEV_ROOT`,
`VELA_PLUGIN_WAIT_DEBUGGER`); **arguments win**. The third source is
`~/.velashell/plugins.dev.txt` (written by `vela-plugin dev link`), which suits "keep this
plugin mounted in my everyday instance forever". All three sources merge; development roots
are scanned **after** the regular ones and first id wins, so a plugin you are developing never
displaces an installed plugin with the same id.

#### After you change code: reload, do not restart

```bash
dotnet build
```

Go back to the plugin manager page and press **Reload** on that plugin's row: deactivate →
unload the ALC / reclaim the process → **re-read the manifest** → load again. The manifest is
re-read too, so a changed version, command set or protocol tab shows up as well.

On Windows this used to be impossible: the ALC loads through `LoadFromAssemblyPath` and holds
the entry DLL open for as long as the plugin lives, which degraded the inner loop into
"close the host → rebuild → start again". Development plugins now **load from a shadow copy**
(`~/.velashell/dev-shadow/<id>/gen-N`, a new generation per load, old ones removed when
possible), so the project's `bin` can be rebuilt at any time. The production path does not use
shadow copies and behaves exactly as before.

To skip even the button: `vela-plugin dev init --watch` (i.e. `--dev-watch`) makes the host
watch the development roots and reload whenever the entry assembly's timestamp changes
(debounced by 1.5 s so the build can finish). It is off by default — file watchers misbehave on
network and shared drives, and that is not a cost everyone should pay by default.

> A development plugin's **disabled state** lives in `~/.velashell/plugins.dev.disabled`, not in
> the build output — otherwise the `.disabled` marker would sit in `bin` and produce the classic
> "but I rebuilt it, why is it still disabled?".

#### Breakpoints

| Plugin shape | How to debug |
| --- | --- |
| `inProcess` | The host process started by F5 already has the debugger attached, and the plugin is loaded into it, so breakpoints hit immediately — including the first line of `ActivateAsync`. With a debugger attached the host stretches the activation timeout from 10 seconds to 10 minutes |
| `isolated` | The plugin runs in a `VelaShell.PluginHost` child process. For plugins matched by `--wait-debugger <id>` the child suspends **before loading the plugin assembly**; its pid is shown on the plugin manager page, printed to the log, and written to `~/.velashell/logs/plugin-host-<id>.pid` |

For plugins matched by `--wait-debugger` the host also **relaxes the activation timeout and
stops the heartbeat** — otherwise a breakpoint freezes every thread in the plugin process, two
missed pings in a row kill it, and the symptom is "the plugin disappears the moment I hit a
breakpoint".

#### When something is wrong, ask doctor

```bash
vela-plugin doctor
```

One pass over: whether a host is registered, the three compatibility gates
(`apiLevel` / `minSdkVersion` / `minHostVersion`), whether the output directory contains
`plugin.json` and a `.deps.json`, whether `VelaShell.PluginSdk.dll` or `Avalonia*.dll` were
accidentally copied into the output, and whether the launch profile still holds a placeholder.
It exits with code 1 when it finds a blocking problem, so it fits in CI.

When you do not want to start the host at all, plugin logic runs in ordinary unit tests against
`TestPluginContext` from `VelaShell.PluginSdk.Testing` (see §7).

## 3. Manifest (`plugin.json`) Reference

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | ✓ | Globally unique, `[a-z0-9.-]`, must start and end with a letter or digit, ≤64 characters. All command ids use it as a prefix |
| `version` | ✓ | semver (`1.2.0` / `1.2.0-beta.1`) |
| `displayName` | ✓ | Display name |
| `entry` | ✓ | Relative path to the entry assembly, must end in `.dll`; absolute paths and `..` segments are rejected |
| `description` | | One-sentence description |
| `publisher` | | Publisher identity (will be bound to the signing key and take part in trust decisions) |
| `author` | | Author, shown on the plugin manager page (e.g. `"Joe <joe@example.com>"`, ≤128 characters, no control characters). When omitted the page falls back to `publisher` |
| `apiLevel` | | Defaults to 1; a generation higher than the host supports is marked Incompatible and not loaded |
| `minHostVersion` | | Minimum required host version; if unmet, the plugin is Incompatible |
| `activationEvents` | | Omitted or containing `"onStartup"` = activate at startup; containing only `"onCommand:<command id>"` = **lazy activation** (load/start the process only when the placeholder command is invoked; the corresponding placeholder must be declared in `contributes.commands`) |
| `contributes.commands` | | Declarative command placeholders `[{id,title,category}]`: available in the command palette during discovery; ids must be prefixed by the plugin id; on activation, the plugin should `Register` a real handler with the same id to replace the placeholder |
| `idlePolicy` | | `"keepAlive"` (default) / `"recyclable"`: in isolated mode, a process is reclaimed after continuous idleness (no RPC and no open panels, 15 minutes by default), while placeholder commands remain available for a later trigger |
| `homepage` / `license` | | Metadata |

JSON comments and trailing commas are allowed. Plugins that fail validation produce a readable reason in the log
(`[PluginManager] Rejected plugin at ...`).

## 4. Lifecycle

```text
Discovered ──activate (background batch after startup)──▶ Active ──host exits──▶ Deactivated
    │                                   │
    ├─ .disabled marker → Disabled      └─ loading/activation error, activation timeout (10s) → Failed (unload ALC)
    ├─ invalid manifest / id conflict → Invalid
    └─ apiLevel / minHostVersion mismatch → Incompatible
```

Contract essentials:

- `ActivateAsync` **must return quickly** (10-second limit): start long-running work in your own background task and use the `context.Shutdown` token to respond to shutdown.
- `DeactivateAsync` has an approximately 2-second limit (application exit path) and is abandoned on timeout. Commands and event subscriptions registered through the SDK are cleaned up automatically by the host; only your own resources need to be finalized.
- Entry type: exactly one public, non-abstract class with `[VelaPlugin]` that implements `IVelaPlugin`, with a public parameterless constructor.
- After deactivation or failure, the ALC is unloaded with `Unload()`: do not put your own types into host static fields or long-lived events, or the assembly cannot be reclaimed.

## 5. Capability API Reference (`IPluginContext`)

### 5.1 Log: Logging

```csharp
context.Log.Info("hello");
context.Log.Error("failed", ex);
```

Writes to the host Trace pipeline, automatically adds the `[Plugin:<id>]` prefix, and is thread-safe.

### 5.2 Storage: Private Key-Value Storage

```csharp
int n = await context.Storage.GetAsync<int>("count", ct);
await context.Storage.SetAsync("count", n + 1, ct);
```

Data is stored in the host's **SonnetDB** (`plugin_data` collection, primary key `<plugin id>|kv|<key>`):

- **Strong isolation by plugin**: the capability instance carries only its own id prefix, so a plugin cannot read another plugin's data (the plugin id character set excludes the separator `|`, so the namespace cannot escape); in isolated processes, RPC routes to the same implementation and the plugin process never connects directly to the database;
- **Automatic cleanup on uninstall**: after the plugin directory is removed from `plugins/`, the host clears its database namespace and data directory as a whole on the next startup (`.disabled` means disabled, not uninstalled, so data is retained);
- A single value should generally be ≤256KB; write large data directly to files under `context.DataDirectory` (also swept on uninstall). A headless host without a database automatically falls back to JSON files in the data directory.

### 5.3 Sessions: Session Enumeration (Redacted)

```csharp
IReadOnlyList<SessionInfo> sessions = await context.Sessions.ListAsync(ct);
SessionInfo? one = await context.Sessions.GetAsync(sessionId, ct);
```

`SessionInfo` contains only connection metadata (host/port/username/status/time), **never credentials**.
`SessionId` is the first parameter of other remote capabilities. v1 plugins cannot initiate connections.

### 5.4 RemoteFs: Remote Files (SFTP)

```csharp
var entries = await context.RemoteFs.ListDirectoryAsync(sid, "/var/www", ct);
RemoteFileEntry? stat = await context.RemoteFs.StatAsync(sid, "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf", ct); // missing → null
byte[] conf = await context.RemoteFs.ReadAllBytesAsync(sid, "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf", ct: ct);
await context.RemoteFs.DownloadFileAsync(sid, "/var/log/app.log", localPath, progress, ct);
```

- Reuses the user's established session channel and does not authenticate again; an invalid session throws `PluginSessionNotFoundException`.
- `StatAsync` returns `null` for a missing path (consistent with host semantics; do not use exceptions to test for existence).
- `ReadAllBytesAsync` has a 16MB limit by default; use `OpenReadAsync` (**read-only sequential stream**, process while reading without a temporary file) or `DownloadFileAsync` for large files. In isolated mode, `OpenReadAsync` fetches chunks over RPC and does not support Seek.
- The host throttles progress callbacks (≥100ms), so you can update state directly.

### 5.5 RemoteExec: One-Off Remote Commands

```csharp
ExecResult r = await context.RemoteExec.RunAsync(sid, "docker ps --format json",
    new ExecOptions { Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10) }, ct);
```

Uses a separate exec channel: it does not enter the user's terminal or pollute shell history and environment. The default timeout is 30s, with a maximum of 10min. It is suitable for probe commands, not interactive or long-running processes.

### 5.6 Commands: Command Palette

```csharp
context.Commands.Register(new(
    $"{context.PluginId}.refresh", "Demo: Refresh", "Demo",
    async ct => { /* Runs on a background thread; exceptions are logged automatically */ }));
```

- The id must be prefixed with `<pluginId>.` (enforced by the host to prevent plugins from impersonating one another).
- After registration, the command appears in the command palette (Ctrl+P / Ctrl+K); the plugin is responsible for title localization (it can retrieve translations through `context.Host.Locale` and re-register on `LocaleChanged`).
- The command body runs on a **background thread**. Do not touch the UI; slow operations will not freeze the interface.
- All commands are automatically unregistered when the plugin is deactivated; the handle returned by `Register` can be used for early unregistration.

### 5.7 Events: Host Events

```csharp
context.Events.SessionConnected += s => context.Log.Info($"{s.Host} connected");
context.Events.ThemeChanged     += theme => ...;
context.Events.LocaleChanged    += locale => ...;
```

Handlers are invoked off the UI thread and **must return quickly without throwing** (exceptions are caught and logged); hand off expensive work to your own background task. Subscriptions are removed automatically on deactivation.

### 5.8 Host: Host Information

`context.Host.AppVersion / ApiLevel / Locale / Theme` (the latter two are live).

### 5.9 Ui: Panels (Full Avalonia)

Plugins use **full Avalonia** to design their own UI: choose compile-time AXAML or pure code, bring your own styles, resources, and localization, and add any third-party component packages (distributed in the plugin directory and isolated from other plugins by the ALC).

**The only hard constraint: the Avalonia version must match the host.** Avalonia-related packages must be compile-only:

```xml
<!-- csproj: version = host version (currently 12.1.1); Avalonia DLLs are never copied into the plugin directory,
     and the loader shares the same set at runtime (in-process = the host's; isolated process = bundled with PluginHost). -->
<PackageReference Include="Avalonia" Version="12.1.1" ExcludeAssets="runtime" />
```

Third-party packages based on Avalonia, such as control libraries, should be referenced normally (their DLLs must be distributed with the plugin; only the `Avalonia*` assemblies themselves are forcibly shared by the loader).

Opening a panel: the host invokes the content factory on the **UI thread**, and you only need to return your control:

```csharp
IPluginPanel panel = await context.Ui.ShowPanelAsync(
    new() { Title = "My Panel", DisplayMode = PanelDisplayMode.Document },
    () => new MyPanelView(context));   // A compile-time AXAML UserControl, or any Control
panel.Closed += () => ...;             // Triggered when the user closes it or the plugin is deactivated
await panel.CloseAsync();              // Programmatic close
```

The plugin chooses the display mode:

- `PanelDisplayMode.Document` — docked tab: enters the main window's tab area, and users can **drag it to any split position** or split it from the context menu, making it equal to terminal/SFTP tabs. **Only inProcess mode** provides true docking; isolated mode always uses a separate card window (cross-process dock embedding conflicts with tab switching and has been deprecated);
- `PanelDisplayMode.Window` — separate window: in-process uses a host-style custom-drawn card window; an isolated process uses the plugin process's own window (automatically follows the host's light or dark theme).

A docked tab can also pick its **placement** (`PanelOptions.Placement`; ignored in window mode):

```csharp
new() { Title = "AI Assistant", Placement = PanelPlacement.Right, PlacementRatio = 0.3 }
```

`Tabs` (the default) joins the current tab group; `Right`/`Left`/`Bottom`/`Top` split off a column at
the matching outer edge of the tab area, sized by `PlacementRatio` (its share of the tab area,
0.15–0.85, default 0.3). Placement goes through the same drag-and-drop docking path, so the result is
identical to the user dragging it there — dragging it back, splitting again, and closing all take the
ordinary route. `PlacementRatio` only sets the width *on open*: a width the user drags is not written
back, so a plugin that wants to remember the preference stores it itself and passes it in next time
(the AI plugin does exactly that — see "Side pane width (%)" on its settings page).

Window mode can also put **action buttons on the title bar** (`PanelOptions.TitleActions`; ignored
when docked): they sit immediately left of the minimize button, in the given order, in the same style
as the tool buttons on the main window's title bar. Use them for entry points that belong to the window
but do not deserve content-area space (the AI plugin's model-settings window opens its global settings this way):

```csharp
new()
{
    Title = "Models", DisplayMode = PanelDisplayMode.Window,
    TitleActions = [new PanelTitleAction(GearPathData, "Global settings", OpenGlobalSettings)]
}
```

The icon is lucide-style 24×24 **SVG path data**, not a resource key — an isolated process has no
access to the host's `Icon.*` resource dictionary; the host scales the stroke to the title-bar size.
The callback runs on the UI thread.

**Theme tokens: write `{DynamicResource VelaXxx}` to follow the host theme.** All of the host's `Vela*` design tokens (semantic brushes, font-size scale, and font families) are available to plugins and follow light/dark switching immediately:

```xml
<Style Selector="TextBlock.title">
  <Setter Property="Foreground" Value="{DynamicResource VelaTextPrimary}" />
</Style>
<Border Background="{DynamicResource VelaBgInput}"
        BorderBrush="{DynamicResource VelaBorderPrimary}" />
<TextBlock Foreground="{DynamicResource VelaAccent}" />
```

- In-process: controls are in the host visual tree, so tokens are naturally available;
- Isolated process: after the handshake, the host sends a token snapshot (resolved for the current light/dark variant) over RPC, and PluginHost injects it into its application resources; it sends the snapshot again when the theme changes, so DynamicResource refreshes automatically. Embedded font sections (`fonts:...#`) do not cross processes; font tokens carry only the system fallback chain.
- Common tokens: `VelaTextPrimary/Secondary/Muted/Tertiary`, `VelaBgSurface/Page/Input/Hover`, `VelaBorderPrimary/Secondary`, `VelaAccent`, `VelaWarning/Error/Info`, `VelaFontSize9..16`, `VelaUiFont/VelaUiMonoFont`. See `src/VelaShell.Controls/Themes/VelaTokens.axaml` and `src/VelaShell/Themes/{Dark,Light}Theme.axaml` in the main repository for the complete list.
- An unresolved token (due to a spelling error or an older host version) leaves the property at its default value and does not report an error. Provide semantic fallbacks for critical colors.

Discipline:

- The plugin directly handles control events and updates (standard Avalonia style; after `await`, execution returns to the UI thread automatically); update controls from background threads through `Dispatcher.UIThread`.
- Attach each control instance to only one panel; a panel is a live control and has no concept of refreshing the entire tree.
- Localization is the plugin's responsibility: retrieve translations through `context.Host.Locale` and hot-update on `LocaleChanged`.
- The host automatically closes all of a plugin's panels when the plugin is deactivated.
- Complete example (compile-time AXAML + bilingual copy + session/remote execution integration): [`plugins/VelaShell.Plugin.HelloWorld`](https://github.com/joesdu/velashell-plugins/tree/main/plugins/VelaShell.Plugin.HelloWorld) (DemoPanelView.axaml).

### 5.10 Secrets: Encrypted Secret Storage

```csharp
await context.Secrets.SetAsync("api-token", token);
string? saved = await context.Secrets.GetAsync("api-token");
await context.Secrets.DeleteAsync("api-token");
```

Difference from Storage: values are **encrypted by the host's secret protector before entering SonnetDB** (on Windows, a local key wrapped with DPAPI; primary key `<plugin id>|secret|<name>`, isolated by plugin and cleared on uninstall just like KV), and in isolated mode secrets are stored only on the host side. Always put API tokens and passwords here, never in Storage.
Suitable for small, short strings; if the protector is unavailable, the capability reports an error directly and never falls back to plaintext.

### 5.11 Terminal: Read/Search/Authorized Writes

```csharp
string tail = await context.Terminal.GetOutputAsync(sid, maxLines: 500);
var hits = await context.Terminal.SearchOutputAsync(sid, "error");         // Substring, case-insensitive
var rx   = await context.Terminal.SearchOutputAsync(sid, @"\d{3} error", isRegex: true);
await context.Terminal.WriteAsync(sid, "docker ps\n");                     // Triggers an authorization dialog
```

- Reading and searching use a **buffer snapshot** (scrollback plus the current screen, plain text without colors); regular expressions have a 1s timeout.
- **Writes require user authorization**: the host dialog offers four choices: Only this time / This run / Always / Deny; "Always allow" is persisted for the plugin in SonnetDB and can be revoked on the plugin management page. A denial throws `PluginPermissionDeniedException` (the plugin should degrade gracefully and not repeatedly bother the user).
- Writes go through the host's existing input serialization queue ("as if typed by the user"), with a limit of ≤4KB per call; a command executes only when a newline is sent.

### 5.12 Clipboard: System Clipboard

```csharp
await context.Clipboard.SetTextAsync(text);
string? current = await context.Clipboard.GetTextAsync();
```

Runs through the host main window (routed over RPC in isolated mode, with identical semantics). The clipboard often contains user passwords:
never log or transmit content that you read.

## 6. Isolated Process Mode (`isolated`)

Declare `"hostMode": "isolated"` in the manifest and the plugin runs in a separate
**VelaShell.PluginHost** process (one process per plugin, implementing the process design in 02/04/05):

```jsonc
{ "id": "acme.my-plugin", ..., "hostMode": "isolated" }
```

- **Zero source changes for the plugin**: the capability interfaces of `IPluginContext` are replaced with RPC proxies on the PluginHost side. This fulfills the SDK's transport-independent design. Change `hostMode` to switch modes.
- **Transport**: named pipe (random name + one-time token + current-user-only access; on macOS/Linux, .NET named pipes use Unix Domain Sockets underneath and are naturally cross-platform). The protocol is a lightweight bidirectional RPC using length-prefixed JSON (see the implementation notes in 05; the dependency tree deliberately does not introduce StreamJsonRpc or MessagePack).
- **Isolation benefits**: a plugin crash or hang affects only itself. Unexpected exits trigger **automatic restart** with backoff (1s → 5s → 30s by default; more than 3 failures within a 5-minute window is marked Failed and automatic recovery is abandoned); two consecutive missed heartbeat responses (30s by default) mark the process hung and force-kill/restart it; when the host exits, the plugin process exits automatically under parent-process supervision and never remains as an orphan.
- **Credentials do not leave the main process**: the plugin process receives only the pipe name and token; SSH keys and passwords never cross the process boundary.
- **Capability differences** (compared with in-process mode):

| Capability | Isolated mode |
| --- | --- |
| Sessions / RemoteExec / RemoteFs | ✅ RPC proxies, identical semantics (transport uses same-machine file paths, and progress returns through notifications) |
| Ui (full Avalonia) | ✅ Avalonia is built into the plugin process and windows are fully functional (software rendering saves memory by default; set `VELA_PLUGIN_GPU=1` to enable it); `Vela*` theme tokens are sent over RPC and are equally available |
| Commands / Events | ✅ Registry remains in the host; triggers and events return through notifications |
| Storage / Log | ✅ KV is routed over RPC into the host's SonnetDB (the plugin process does not write local files); logs are forwarded to the host with local Trace as a fallback |
| Secrets / Clipboard | ✅ Routed over RPC to execute on the host (secrets are encrypted and persisted only on the host side) |
| Dock into the main window's tab area | ❌ **Always a separate card window** (stable and consistent with the main program). Cross-process dock embedding (HWND adoption) has fundamental tension with dock tab reparenting (stuttering and windows floating out), and is **deprecated**; use inProcess for true docked tabs. The stable cross-platform solution is the shared-memory surface in blueprint 08 (future) |
| `CancellationToken` propagation across processes | ⚠️ Not propagated; both sides use timeouts as a fallback (`exec` follows `ExecOptions.Timeout`) |

- **Selection guidance**: use the default `inProcess` for first-party or trusted plugins (zero IPC overhead and draggable docked panels); use `isolated` for third-party or experimental plugins (one extra process provides crash isolation, with panels displayed in separate card windows).

## 7. Testing Plugins

Reference `VelaShell.PluginSdk.Testing` to write pure in-memory unit tests without the host:

```csharp
using VelaShell.PluginSdk.Testing;

[TestMethod]
public async Task Refresh_ListsContainers()
{
    using var ctx = new TestPluginContext();
    SessionInfo session = ctx.FakeSessions.AddConnected(host: "prod-1");
    ctx.FakeRemoteExec.Handler = (_, cmd) => cmd.StartsWith("docker ps") ? "abc123 nginx" : "";

    var plugin = new DemoPlugin();
    await plugin.ActivateAsync(ctx, CancellationToken.None);
    await ctx.RecordingCommands.RunAsync("velashell.demo.refresh");

    Assert.IsTrue(ctx.CollectingLog.Entries.Any(e => e.Message.Contains("nginx")));
}
```

Test doubles: `CollectingLogger`, `InMemoryStorage`, `FakeSessions`, `FakeRemoteFs`
(an in-memory path tree with semantics aligned to the real implementation), `FakeRemoteExec` (scripted responses),
`RecordingCommands` (use `RunAsync` to drive command bodies), `TestHostEvents` (the `Raise` method),
`TestHostInfo`, `FakeUi` (records panels and lazy content factories), `FakeSecrets`, and `FakeClipboard`.

## 8. Deployment, Disabling, and Troubleshooting

| Item | Location/Method |
| --- | --- |
| Built-in application plugins | `<application directory>/plugins/<id with dots replaced by hyphens>/` (for example, `plugins/velashell-ai/`; see §2.1) |
| Manually installed plugins | `~/.velashell/plugins/<id>/` (this is outside the `.app` and does not participate in signing, so the directory is still named by id) |
| Plugin data | KV/secrets in the host's SonnetDB (`plugin_data` collection); files in `<data root>/plugin-data/<id>/` |
| Uninstallation cleanup | Remove the plugin directory from `plugins/` → the next startup automatically clears its database data and data directory as a whole (`.disabled` only disables it and retains data) |
| Disable one plugin | Place an empty `.disabled` file in the plugin directory |
| Disable all plugins (troubleshooting) | Environment variable `VELASHELL_DISABLE_PLUGINS=1` |
| Id conflict | First match wins according to root-directory order (application directory first); the later one is marked Invalid |
| Logs | Debug output/Trace, with `[PluginManager]` and `[Plugin:<id>]` prefixes |

## 9. Performance and Behavior Discipline

The host is a terminal application that is extremely sensitive to memory and latency. Plugins must follow these rules:

1. **Do not block**: `ActivateAsync` must return in seconds; event handlers and command bodies must not wait on synchronous I/O.
2. **Do not poll**: use events instead of timers; when a timer is truly necessary, use an interval of ≥5s and stop it immediately when `Shutdown` is triggered.
3. **Use only the `Ui` capability for UI**: the host invokes panel content factories on the UI thread; command bodies and event handlers run on background threads, and controls must be updated through `Dispatcher.UIThread`. Reflection into the host's internal UI is not covered by compatibility guarantees.
4. **Manage memory**: download large files to disk instead of reading them into memory; cap caches; release everything on deactivation (otherwise the ALC cannot be reclaimed and memory grows steadily).
5. **Be friendly to remote systems**: combine probe commands into one execution (one exec with multiple output sections) instead of sending a command to the remote host every second.

## 10. Versioning and Compatibility Guarantees

- **apiLevel (currently = 1)**: within a generation, the SDK only adds and never changes or removes items (interface methods, DTO fields, and manifest schema). Breaking changes raise apiLevel; the host rejects plugins from a higher generation and gives a clear message.
- **minHostVersion**: declare this when the plugin depends on newer host capabilities. An older host marks the plugin Incompatible instead of allowing a runtime failure.
- **SDK package version vs. assembly version**: the five SDK packages are versioned **independently of the host** and released on their own cadence. On the assembly side:
  - `AssemblyVersion` is `<major>.0.0.0` and **moves only with the major** — plugins bind to that identity at compile time, so moving it per patch would force every compiled plugin to rebind for nothing;
  - `FileVersion` and `InformationalVersion` carry the full version (the latter including the prerelease suffix), so the Explorer property page and `vela-plugin` report the real version rather than being stuck at 1.0.0;
  - the rule is **SDK major == apiLevel**. A major bump means the contract broke, so `apiLevel` goes up with it and an older host rejects the plugin at **discovery** time with a readable reason, instead of throwing an assembly binding error at load time.
- **Host-mode independence**: capability interfaces are transport-independent. Switching `hostMode` between inProcess and isolated requires no plugin source changes (this is implemented); the only exception is behavior that differs in isolated mode, as shown in the capability differences table in §6.

## 11. Deliberate Gaps from the Long-Term Blueprint

| Blueprint capability | v1 status |
| --- | --- |
| One process + IPC per plugin (02/04/05) | **Implemented** (`hostMode: "isolated"`, see §6): named pipes + lightweight RPC + heartbeat + automatic crash-restart backoff |
| Permission system + Broker (06) | Not implemented: v1 targets first-party and self-installed plugins; installation implies trust |
| UI contribution points / VelaUI (08) | Available: command-palette commands + full Avalonia panels (dockable tabs in inProcess; always separate card windows in isolated processes) + plugin management page. The VelaUI declarative tree is **not being pursued** by user decision; cross-process dock embedding is deprecated (see the notes in 08); sidebar/status-bar mounting points are deferred |
| `.vpx` packaging / signing / store (03/10) | **Packaging and signing are implemented** (own container + ECDSA signatures, see §12); **the marketplace has a client**: `vela-plugin install/search/update/list/uninstall` against [market.easilynet.top](http://market.easilynet.top) or a self-hosted source (see the [CLI manual](cli.md#2-installing-from-the-marketplace)). **A marketplace UI inside the host is still future work** |
| Activation events / lazy activation (03) | **Implemented**: `onStartup` / `onCommand:<id>` + `contributes.commands` placeholders; other event types (onSessionConnect/onFileOpen, etc.) are deferred |
| Idle reclamation (04) | **Implemented** (isolated mode + `idlePolicy: "recyclable"`) |
| secrets / clipboard capability domains (07) | **Implemented** (§5.10/§5.11; without a permission system, installation implies trust) |
| terminal / localFs / audio / ai and other capability domains (07) | Not opened; any new capability domain must be added back to the blueprint and only add to the API without changing it |

Discipline for adding capabilities: first record them in this file and the corresponding blueprint document, then add the interface to `VelaShell.PluginSdk`; within the same apiLevel, only add and never change.

## 12. The `.vpx` Package Format and Signing

`.vpx` is VelaShell's **own container format**, not a renamed zip: general-purpose archivers
cannot open it, and the host refuses to install a plain zip. The implementation lives in
`plugin-sdk/VelaShell.PluginSdk/Packaging/VpxContainer.cs`; reading (host install) and writing
(`vela-plugin pack`) share that one file, so "the tool produced a package the host will not take"
cannot happen.

### 12.1 Layout

Little-endian; the header is a fixed 64 bytes:

```text
Offset  Size  Contents
0       4     Magic 56 50 58 1A ("VPX" + 0x1A)
4       2     Container format version (currently 1)
6       2     Flags (bit0 = payload masked, bit1 = signature block present)
8       8     Payload length in bytes
16      32    Payload SHA-256
48      8     Mask nonce
56      4     Header CRC32 (over the first 56 bytes)
60      4     Reserved
64      N     Payload: zip bytes (transformed when masking is on)
64+N    4+M   Optional signature block: int32 length + UTF-8 JSON
```

- The trailing `0x1A` is the DOS end-of-file marker, borrowed from PNG: `type` / `cat` on the
  package stops there instead of spraying a screenful of noise.
- **Masking** XORs 32-byte blocks with `SHA-256(nonce ‖ block index)`. It is self-inverse and
  randomly addressable, which is why the payload stream stays seekable (a hard requirement of
  `ZipArchive` in read mode) while `PK\x03\x04` is nowhere to be found in the file.

> To be explicit about the boundary: **the magic bytes and the mask are format identification and
> a guard against mistakes, not a security boundary.** A plugin is native executable code, so
> anything needed to "decrypt" it is necessarily on the client; a determined person can always
> peel the payload out. Real integrity and provenance come from SHA-256 (corruption and truncation)
> and the signature (tampering and impersonation).

### 12.2 Signing

The algorithm is **ECDSA P-256 + SHA-256** over the 64-byte header — and since the header carries
the payload length and digest, that is equivalent to signing the whole package. Ed25519 was
deliberately not used: it is not in the BCL, and pulling in a third-party library would break the
"the contract assembly has no heavyweight dependencies" rule (blueprint 10 §1 originally specified
Ed25519 and has been amended).

```bash
vela-plugin keygen -o acme.pem                    # create a key pair, print the public key (Base64 SPKI)
vela-plugin pack bin/Release/net11.0 -k acme.pem  # pack and sign
# or during a build: dotnet build -c Release -t:PackVpx -p:VelaSigningKey=acme.pem
vela-plugin verify pkg.vpx -k <public key base64> # check the payload digest and the signature
vela-plugin info   pkg.vpx                        # header, signature state and manifest
```

The four verdicts and how the host acts on them:

| Verdict | Meaning | Host behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Unsigned` | No signature block | Allowed by default (first-party / self-installed plugins: trust equals install) |
| `Trusted` | Valid signature whose key is in the trusted set (with no set configured, any valid signature counts) | Allowed, with a log line |
| `Untrusted` | Valid signature, key not in the trusted set | Allowed by default; rejected when `RequireTrustedPackageSignature` is on |
| `Invalid` | Signature block corrupt or verification failed | **Always rejected**, regardless of policy — that is tampering, which is far worse than "unsigned" |

The trusted set and the strict switch live on `PluginManagerOptions` (`TrustedPackageKeys` /
`RequireTrustedPackageSignature`) and are both off by default.

The command line is one notch stricter: `vela-plugin install` refuses unsigned packages when
**non-interactive** (pass `--allow-unsigned` to install one anyway) and takes
`--trust <fingerprint>` so "it must be signed by this publisher" can be written into CI.
A marketplace UI inside the host, and publisher verification, remain future work per blueprint 10.

### 12.3 Other Install-Time Gates

- **Zip slip**: any entry that would land outside the target directory is rejected.
- **Zip bombs**: at most 10,000 entries and 512 MB unpacked, accounted by **bytes actually written** —
  the length in the central directory is written by the package itself, so a bomb can happily
  claim 1 KB and then emit 10 GB.
- **Payload cap**: 512 MB per package, which also bounds a garbage length in a corrupt header.

### 12.4 There Is No Plain-Zip Compatibility Mode

The host accepts **containers only**: a renamed zip is always rejected, with the remedy in the
error message itself (`this is a plain zip archive - repack it with vela-plugin pack`).

No compatibility switch exists on purpose. No `.vpx` package was ever shipped before the container
format was defined, so there is no installed base to protect — and keeping a "looks like a plugin
package, install it" side door would give away the format's main value while forcing two extraction
paths to be maintained forever.
